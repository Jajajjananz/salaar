                <p>Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (transl. Commander: Part 1 – Ceasefire) is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language epic action thriller film written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur. The film stars Prabhas as the title character alongside an ensemble cast of Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj, Brahmaji, Mime Gopi and Easwari Rao. Set in the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship between Deva (Prabhas), the exiled prince of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj), the current prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help to become Khansaar's undisputed rule. <br> <br>
                    The film's initial storyline was pitched from Prashanth Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014)[6] and is the maiden part of a two-part film. It was officially announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023, the official title was announced as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays, postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal Kulkarni. <br>

Salaar received an A (adults only) classification from the CBFC[7] and was theatrically released on 22 December 2023 in standard and IMAX formats. The film opened to generally positive reviews from critics, with Neel's direction, story, world building, characterization, cast performances, action sequences, music, background scores, cinematography, technical aspects, and the realistic depiction of modern-day monarchy receiving praise. It was a commercial success, earning ₹617–700 crore on a ₹270 crore budget, making it the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2023, fifth highest-grossing Telugu film of all time, sixth highest-grossing South Indian film of all time, fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, and the 15th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.[3][4][5]
